## Introduction

Understanding data structures is fundamental to writing efficient and scalable code. This library includes classic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each data structure is implemented in various programming languages for your convenience.

## Available Data Structures

1. **Array**: Simple dynamic array implementation.
2. **Linked List**: Singly and doubly linked list implementations.
3. **Stack**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.
4. **Queue**: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.
5. **Tree**: Binary tree and AVL tree implementations.
6. **Graph**: Adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations.
7. **Hash Table**: Basic hash table with chaining.
8. **Heap**: Min-heap and max-heap implementations.

Each data structure is organized into its own directory, containing implementation files and example usage.

## How to Use

To use a specific data structure, follow these general steps:

1. Navigate to the directory of the desired data structure.
2. Choose the programming language directory that suits your needs.
3. Include or import the relevant files into your project.
4. Use the provided methods and functions to interact with the data structure.

Make sure to check the documentation and comments within the source code for detailed information on usage and any specific considerations.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add a new data structure, improve an existing implementation, or provide examples in additional programming languages, please follow the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). Please adhere to the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Happy coding!
